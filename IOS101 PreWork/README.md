Idea:
I want to make a spotify clone where you can scroll through your friends playlists and message
them through the app. The app will include playlist sharing directly through the app with 
playlist metadata. Also, there will be a friend interaction where users can see what their 
friends are currently listening to with options to "like", "comment", or "recommend".
